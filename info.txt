// conversion of excel file into csv file step by step guid

To convert an Excel file to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, you can use Microsoft Excel itself or other tools like LibreOffice Calc. Here are the steps to do it in Microsoft Excel:

Using Microsoft Excel:

Open the Excel file that you want to convert to CSV.

Select the worksheet that you want to convert. If you want to convert the entire workbook, you can skip this step.

Click "File" in the top menu.

Click "Save As."

Choose a location where you want to save the CSV file.

In the "Save as type" dropdown, select "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)".

Click "Save."

If a warning about saving in CSV format appears, click "OK."

If you've selected a specific worksheet, you may be prompted to confirm that you want to save only that worksheet. Click "OK" to proceed.

Your Excel file will be saved in CSV format at the specified location.

Using LibreOffice Calc:

If you don't have Microsoft Excel, you can use LibreOffice Calc, which is a free and open-source spreadsheet software. Here's how to convert an Excel file to CSV using LibreOffice Calc:

Open LibreOffice Calc.

Click "File" and then "Open" to open your Excel file.

Select the worksheet that you want to convert. If you want to convert the entire workbook, you can skip this step.

Click "File" and then "Save As."

Choose a location where you want to save the CSV file.

In the "Save as type" dropdown, select "Text CSV (.csv)".

Click "Save."

You will be presented with CSV export options. Ensure that the settings match your requirements, such as the field delimiter (usually a comma) and text delimiter (usually none). Click "OK" to proceed.

Your Excel file will be saved in CSV format with the specified settings.

After performing these steps, you'll have a CSV file that can be easily used as input in your C++ program or any other application that supports CSV files.
